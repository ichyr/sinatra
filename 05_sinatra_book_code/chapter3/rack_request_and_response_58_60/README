Dealing with HTTP is simple: you get
a request and return a response. 

Rack defines a protocol for communication between an application object 
(provided by the webapp: Sinatra, Rails, etc.) and a HTTP server (thin, webrick, mongrel ...)

A Rack application is a Ruby object that responds
to a method named "call". The method "call" takes exactly one argument, 
the "environment" and returns
an "Array" of exactly three values: 
  1. The status code, (for example 200) 
  2. the headers (a hash-like object), and 
  3. the body (an array-like object. Has to respond to "each").

The application object is usually referred as an "end-point"
The server is often called the "handler"
