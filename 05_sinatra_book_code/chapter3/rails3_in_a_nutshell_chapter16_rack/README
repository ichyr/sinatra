Rails 3 in a Nutshell.  Chapter 16. Rack

    Rack is a simple specification and Ruby library for connecting web
    servers to web applications. Because each web server has a different
    API, it has traditionally been required for Ruby web framework
    developers to write an adapter for each web server they wanted their
    framework to support. Given m web frameworks and n web servers you
    end up with m * n web server adapters being implemented. This is
    clearly not a sustainable approach or a valuable use of a framework
    developer's time. The Rack specification is based on the Web Server
    Gateway Interface (WSGI) utilized by Python web applications.
    Basically, the specification defines two things: an environment,
    which is a hash that contains CGI-like headers describing the request
    and a response, which is an array of values including the response
    code, response headers, and response body.
    ...

    Rack is based on the concept of a "request environment". The environment
    is a hash of CGI-like headers. For details on the exact format and
    requirements of the Rack environment you can view the complete Rack
    spec at
